<h1>Welcome to Chess Journal</h1>

    Hi, I'm Orfeo, the creator of Chess Journal. I'm a computer science student passionate about chess and technology. I designed this app to help players track, analyze, and share their games with ease. I hope you find it as enjoyable to use as I did creating it!

<p>Feel free to explore the app and make the most of your chess journey!</p>
